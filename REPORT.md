### Framework

The code is written in PyTorch and Python 3.

### Training Code

The repository (or zip file) includes functional, well-documented, and organized code for training the agent.

### Model Weights

The saved model weights of the successful agent are located in the file: xxxxx

### Learning Algorithm

The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.

### Plot of rewards

A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.

### Ideas for Future Work

The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
